## Frontend boilerplate

This is simply project for frontend development with some things

 - clinch for CommonJS and CoffeeScript
 - jade for awesome templates
 - stylus for unfunky CSS
 - twitter bootstrap

Also its have some `grunt`s tasks for development with on-the-fly compilations and gathering static version of app.

## How to use it

Just clone it and feel free to modify everything.

## Why I do it

I use `clinch` and `jade` and `stylus` - so, I put all in one bag with handles.
